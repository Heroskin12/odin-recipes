# odin-recipes
The first Odin Project HTML test.

This first project asks the user to create a basic website using only HMTL that will display some recipes.

I added in recipes for honey mustard grilled chicken, greek lamb souvlaki and turkey burgers.

File Structure

In the odin-recipes directory, I created an index.html file.

Furthermore, I created two other directories: recipes and images.

Recipes contained the html pages for each individual recipe, while images contained the pictures of those recipes.

CSS will be completed in a later commit.
